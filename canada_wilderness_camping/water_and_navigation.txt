**Finding Water and Navigating the Backcountry**

- Always filter or boil lake/river water before drinking
- Bring detailed topographic maps and a compass
- Learn to use GPS, but never rely on it solely
- Mark landmarks and note elevation changes
- Avoid camping within 60 meters of lakeshores when possible

Plan your route before leaving and inform someone of your expected return date.
